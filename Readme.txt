Arduino Projects

The repository contains slides for getting started with Arduino programming and sensors. The projects are of escalating difficulty, for complete beginners to advanced arduino programmers.
There are also guidelines and circuit designs, in order to learn how to connect electronic components and sensors to the microcontroller (you will also learn how these components work). 
At the end, you can follow the guidelines and make your own arduino robot and a smart home.

The code for the projects is included in the slides and in the 'Arduino scripts' folder too.
You can implement some projects to TinkerCAD, if you don't have an Arduino microcontroller.
